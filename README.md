# Project-10
Integrated Project 2

The aim of this project is to analyze and optimize the mineral processing operations for gold extraction (tho other metals are involved: , silver, and lead). Through a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, we seek to understand the patterns and relationships inherent in the data, ultimately aiming to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the extraction process. 

This involves preprocessing the data to ensure its integrity and completeness, followed by a detailed analysis of key variables such as metal concentrations and feed sizes at different stages of the process. 

By leveraging regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, we aim to predict the recovery rates of valuable metals accurately. Through this analysis, we aim to provide insights that can inform decision-making and drive improvements in the mineral processing industry.
